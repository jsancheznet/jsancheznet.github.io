The controller rotation has priority over the pawn it is controlling. Setting the pawn rotation will do nothing if it is being controlled by a controller. You will need to set the controller rotation instead. So if your pawn is having problems rotating, it might be that the controller is overwriting it.\nNaming Conventions\rUnreal Engine Prefixes\rUnreal uses prefixes when naming their classes, these are the most common ones.\nPrefix Meaning U Derives from UObject A Derives from Actor F Structs E Enums I Interfaces Source Files\rIt is customary to add a prefix to all your source code files. This makes files easily distinguishable from engine files and other projects.\nFor example we could choose the prefix \u0026lsquo;RPG\u0026rsquo; for a project and our source files should be \u0026ldquo;RPGMyCharacter.h/cpp\u0026rdquo;.\nEditor Tips\rResetting variables to their default state\rThere\u0026rsquo;s a little arrow next to variables, clicking reset\u0026rsquo;s the value to it\u0026rsquo;s default state\nC\u0026#43;\u0026#43; Tips\rWhenever possible, forward declare\rTry to not include headers in C++ class definitions. It is better to forward declare them for faster compilation times. Including headers will result in huge translation units.\nOrder your code\rIt\u0026rsquo;s a good idea to order your C++ implementations in the order they are executed. Example, constructor should be near the top, BeginPlay should be after the constructor and PostInitializeComponents should be before BeginPlay. This will make your code easier to navigate.\nStepping into engine code\rTo use the debugger with Unreal\u0026rsquo;s engine code, you need to download the editor symbols for debugging. This can be done from Epic Game\u0026rsquo;s Launcher.\nCasting\rUnreal has it\u0026rsquo;s own template for casting, it\u0026rsquo;s recommended to use this instead of regular C style casting.\n1 ClassToCastTo *MyPtr = Cast\u0026lt;ClassToCastTo\u0026gt;(Pointer); Static Class\rWhen you need a variable to hold a class type, the following returns the class type. It\u0026rsquo;s used in functions like: GetComponentByClass\n1 ClassName::StaticClass(); Asserts\r\u0026ldquo;Ensure\u0026rdquo; will assert but continue the game after. By default it will only halt execution once. \u0026ldquo;ensureAlways\u0026rdquo; is another flavor of ensure, but this one will always halt execution.\n\u0026ldquo;check\u0026rdquo; will halt execution when it\u0026rsquo;s evaluation is false.\nAActor::PostInitializeComponents\rThis function runs before BeginPlay. It\u0026rsquo;s a good place to bind to component events, like: \u0026ldquo;OnComponentHit\u0026rdquo;.\nConst UFUNCTION\rSetting a UFUNCTION to const will make it appear as a green node with no execution pin inside blueprints.\nBlueprint Tips\rHow to know what class/namespace does a node belong to\rA good way to know what class/namespace a blueprint node belongs to i to mouse over it and looking at it\u0026rsquo;s target.\nVariables or Functions not appearing in the editor\rSometimes variables or functions won\u0026rsquo;t appear in the blueprint editor, most likely you forgot to add a property specifier. Check your C++ code.\nGet Default Values of a Class\rTo get a class default values, you can use the node \u0026ldquo;GetClassDefaults\u0026rdquo;\nDevelopment Tips\rUse Debug Shapes\rUnreal has a bunch of debug shapes ready to be used, they are really useful when developing and debugging features. These are a few of them.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 DrawDebugPoint(...); DrawDebugSphere(...); DrawDebugCircle(...); DrawDebugCircle(...); DrawDebugSolidBox(...); DrawDebugBox(...); DrawDebugLine(...); DrawDebugDirectionalArrow(...); DrawDebugCrosshairs(...); Get Component By Class\rUse GetComponentByClass to find a specific component. This is faster than casting to player and accessing the component from player. This also has less error of invalid pointer, casting might fail.\nTeleporting Actors\rAlways use the actor builtin function TeleportTo when teleporting actors. It covers a lot of edge cases when teleporting an actor, such as collision detection \u0026amp; resolution.\nMath Tips\rHow to find a point in space where we are looking\rIn order to find a point in space where we are looking, or where a rotator is pointing.\nYou need to get it\u0026rsquo;s rotator, transform it to a vector, add the actor\u0026rsquo;s location and scale the rotation vector.\n1 2 // GetRotation.Vector is the same thing as GetDirection(), Actor.GetDirection * 1000.0f; FVector Point = Actor.GetLocation() + (Actor.GetRotation().Vector * 1000.0f); Interfaces\rInterfaces are useful to create a standardized API that different actors or object might implement.\nWhen an Interface function is marked as BlueprintNativeEvent, the function definition must append \u0026ldquo;_Implementation\u0026rdquo; to it\u0026rsquo;s name.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 // Header UFUNCTION(BlueprintNativeEvent) MyInterfaceFunction() // Definition MyInterfaceFunction_Implementation() { .... } When an interface function is marked as BlueprintNativeEvent or BlueprintImplementable, to call it from C++ you need to prepend \u0026ldquo;Execute_\u0026rdquo; to the function name.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 // Header UFUNCTION(BlueprintNativeEvent) MyInterfaceFunction(); // The function must be called like this Execute_MyInterfaceFunction(); UMG\rUMG Tips\rAdd widget to another widget\rYou can add other widget to a widget. For example you could have a HUD widget, and health could be another widget. This allows us to separate things and make blueprints more modular.\nAdd boxed as parent to align them\rYou can add Boxes and set the box as parent of other widget to make them auto aligned.\nBind\rYou can click on bind button to add a function that runs every frame and updates the value of something. This is not recommended since running everyfame is very expensive. Prefer using delegates to update values on change/update.\nGet player\u0026amp;rsquo;s character from UMG\ruse GetOwningPlayerPawn to get the player\u0026rsquo;s character\n1 GetOwningPlayerPawn(); Construct/BeginPlay\rConstruct is the BeginPlay of UMG objects. This is a good place to bind to the needed delegates!\nDon\u0026amp;rsquo;t call widget functions from outside\rDon\u0026rsquo;t create functions inside widgets and call them from actors. Make the UI separate from game code to avoid mantainance nightmares. Never call widgets functions from outside.\nUse PreConstruct to set values\rSet things such as colors and values in the pre construct event.\nMake a widget have input parameters on creation\rChecking \u0026ldquo;Expose on spawn\u0026rdquo; to a variable makes that variable be an input to the CreateWidget node. This way we can set variables when a widget is being created.\nWorld Position to Screen Position\rThe node \u0026ldquo;ProjectWorldToScreen\u0026rdquo; transforms a position in world coordinates to screen coordinates.\nIf the screen coordinate seems weirdly off, try dividing ScreenPosition/GetViewPortScale.\nRemoving a widget from screen\rTo remove a widget from screen we need to call the function \u0026ldquo;RemoveFromParent\u0026rdquo;.\nMaterials\rMaterials are just shaders that are programmed using unreal\u0026rsquo;s nodes instead of glsl/hlsl. Materials are the blueprint/classes and material instances are the instances of materials.\nSuch as with glsl uniform variables, you can set input and parameters to a material.\nMaterial Instances\rMaterial instances cannot add/edit behaviours. Only variables exposed by a material are editable.\nMaterial Functions\rYou can create material functions. These functions are able to be reutilized inside other materials.\nMaterial functions can have Input, search for the input node.\nWhen creating a material function, be sure to check the \u0026ldquo;Expose to library\u0026rdquo; checkbox. If you don\u0026rsquo;t do this, the function won\u0026rsquo;t appear in the material function list.\nMaterial Functions can have multiple outputs!\nBuiltin Functions\rThere are a lot of complex functions already implemented for you in the material editor. I recommend having a look at them before implementing something inside a material, there\u0026rsquo;s a chance that what you want is already implemented and the solution might be to add a single node.\nDebugging/Visualizing Scalar Values\rOne way of visualizing scalar values is to use the node \u0026ldquo;DebugScalarValues\u0026rdquo;. It prints a scalar value onto the mesh active in the material. It\u0026rsquo;s a good way of debugging values inside a shader/material.\nUsing Materials in UMG\rIn order to use a material in UMG/User Interfaces, we need to set the Material Domain to \u0026ldquo;User Interace\u0026rdquo;\nSound\rSound Cues\rSound Cues are the programmable audio assets. As with all thing in unreal you can program the sound using it\u0026rsquo;s specific nodes. Maybe add a reverb or something else\u0026hellip;\nShortcuts\rAsset Searching\rCtrl+P opens a window to search for assets. It\u0026rsquo;s really fast since as soon as you press the shortcut you can start typing.\nMove around in PIE without stopping the simulation\rPress F8 while playing in editor to be able to move around without stopping the simulation. Press F8 again to go back to your camera view.\nAnim Blueprints\rThe event graph run every frame! To be more specific, the \u0026ldquo;Event Blueprint Update Animation\u0026rdquo; runs every frame.\nThe event graph inside an animation blueprint is able to set variables which are to be used inside the animation graphs to set the correct pose.\nAI Tips\rDebugging Tips\rPress the apostrophe key (\u0026rsquo;) to open the in-game AI Debugger. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of information there.\nPress the key while looking at an AI to show the info about it\u0026rsquo;s ai instance\nNavmesh\rNavmesh: The navmesh provides data on where the AI is allowed to move.\nAIController\rWhen creating an AIController in C++ it still needs a blueprint that inherits from it.\nBlackboard Component\rYou can get the blackboard component in AIController with the function GetBlackboardComponent\nTo change a value in a blackboard component, use the function:\n1 BlackboardComponent-\u0026gt;SetValueAs...(...) BTServices\rTo create BTServices in C++ you need to inherit from \u0026ldquo;BTService\u0026rdquo;, if you are creating them from Blueprints, inherit from \u0026ldquo;BTService_BlueprintBase\u0026rdquo;.\nIn order to not hardcode blackboard keys as test in C++, you can create a variable like the following and set the key on the editor.\n1 2 UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere) FBlackboardKeySelector MyKey; To run a Service each frame, add the frame to the rootnode of the Behavior Tree.\nBTTasks\rTo create a BTTask node in C++, inherit ftrom BTTaskNode. To create one in blueprints, inherit from BTTask_BlueprintBase.\nMarking values with UPROPERTY specifiers, make these variables editable inside the behaviour tree when selecting the corresponding node.\nDecorators\rDecorators have a vew flow control capabilities inside the details window of a decorator. Let\u0026rsquo;s say we have a decorator that depends on a bool. To instantly stop execution on that subtree when this bool changes, set NotifyObserver to: \u0026ldquo;OnResultChange\u0026rdquo; and ObserverAborts to: Self.\nIf you click on a decorator, unreal engine will apply color to different nodes. For example, unreal will color light blue those nodes that are aborted by low priority mode. Green those that are aborted by mode Self. Unreal always colors the nodes that are affected from what we have currently selected.\nEQS\rEQS Queries can be run from behaviour trees.\nThe \u0026ldquo;Querier\u0026rdquo; is the class that is running the query. If we run it from a BT, the querier is the AI running that BT. Queries can also be called from other classes such as game mode.\nWhen running an EQS from a BT, remember to set the key for the output value. For example, if running a query that will return a location, remember to set the output location key.\nIn the AI Visual debugger (\u0026rsquo;) key, press numpad 3 to enable EQS visualization for the selected AI. Blue means it failed, green succeeded. Each sphere is a queried location/point.\n","date":"Mar 20","permalink":"https://jsanchez.net/post/tom_looman_course_notes/","tags":null,"title":"Notes from Professional Game Development in C++ and Unreal Engine"},{"categories":null,"contents":"\rWhat is collision detection?\rWikipedia defines collision detection as \u0026ldquo;the computational problem of detecting the intersection of two or more objects\u0026rdquo;. In real life you cannot go through objects but in a computer simulation objects can overlap and go through each other. In order to resemble reality we need a way to detect when objects are overlapping.\nImagine two billiard balls, one of them is moving towards the other. In the real world they collide and each ball goes in a different direction. When programming a simulation we need to check every frame for collision, and when a collision is found resolve it.\nCollision detection is a broad and complex problem, and if that wasn\u0026rsquo;t enough it is also coupled with simulations and physics.\nIn this article I will only talk about collision detection of two or more circles in 2 dimensions(although the same algorithm works for 3D spheres), and to make it a little more fun I will explain one of the many ways of making things interact besides checking if they are colliding or not.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a preview of what we will be implementing.\nPrerequisites\rI have to draw the knowledge required line somewhere, and this is it. Nothing of what i\u0026rsquo;m about to explain/use is hard or complex. You can learn it in a few minutes. The internet is full of guides and this one will do the job just fine.\nThese are the things you need to know:\nWhat is a circle\u0026rsquo;s radius What is a vector Subtracting two vectors Magnitude of a vector Normalizing a vector Scaling a vector I will be programming in C since it\u0026rsquo;s my favourite language, feel free to translate the code to your language and style of your choice. Let\u0026rsquo;s start by defining vector and circle structs.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 typedef struct vec2 { float x, y; } vec2; typedef struct circle { vec2 Center; // Center are the coordinates of the circle center float Radius; } circle; Now let\u0026rsquo;s define some functions we will need.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 vec2 Subtract(vec2 A, vec2 B) { vec2 Result = {0}; Result.x = A.x - B.x; Result.y = A.y - B.y; return Result; } float Magnitude(vec2 A) { return sqrtf(A.x * A.x + A.y * A.y); } vec2 Normalize(vec2 A) { vec2 Result = {0}; float Length = Magnitude(A); Result.x = A.x / Length; Result.y = A.y / Length; return Result; } Checking if two circles collide\rChecking if two circles collide is really easy. If the distance between the two circle\u0026rsquo;s center is less than the sum of their radii, they are colliding. Play around with the following example and you should get the idea. The black line represents the distance between the two circles, and the radii sum is just the sum of both circle\u0026rsquo;s radii.\nThe code\rThe following function returns just a boolean, wether the input circles are colliding or not.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 bool Collide(circle A, circle B) { vec2 Difference = Subtract(A.Center, B.Center); float Distance = Magnitude(Difference); float RadiiSum = A.Radius + B.Radius; if(Distance \u0026lt; RadiiSum) { return true; } else { return false; } } Basic collision interaction\rHere we are going to do the red and blue circle interaction seen on the first section.\nIn order to move the circles apart we need what is called the \u0026ldquo;minimum translation vector\u0026rdquo;, in other words it\u0026rsquo;s how much the circles are overlapping. With this length, we can simply move both circles apart or just one as i did with the red one.\nTo get the minimum translation vector we subtract the distance from the radiisum and take the absolute value of the result. After that we need to get the normalized direction vector of the distance. After that we just need to add the movement to the red circle.\nMath in words makes everyone dizzy, and i\u0026rsquo;m not good at explaining. Code is a more elegant medium.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 void Simulate(circle A, circle *B) { // Be aware that circle B is a pointer, this is because we are // going to update it\u0026#39;s position. B is the same as the red circle // in the previous demo window. // Abs -\u0026gt; Absolute value // MTD -\u0026gt; Minimum translation distance if(Collide(A, *B)) { float RadiiSum = A.Radius + B-\u0026gt;Radius; float MTD = Abs(Distance - RadiiSum); vec2 Direction = Normalize(Subtract(A.Center, B-\u0026gt;Center)); B-\u0026gt;x += Direction.x * MTD; B-\u0026gt;Y += Direction.y * MTD; } } This last section is a bit more complicated, if you don\u0026rsquo;t understand something, i recommend doing sketches on pen and paper, that usually helps me.\nI\u0026rsquo;m happy you read this whole thing, thank you, you are awesome.\nUntil next time.\n","date":"Apr 05","permalink":"https://jsanchez.net/post/collision_circle_circle/","tags":null,"title":"Collision Detection: Circle vs Circle"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Dear Imgui is an awesome C/C++ immediate mode graphical user interface (GUI) made by ocornut. It provides just about every widget you might need, buttons, color pickers, plots and many, many more. It\u0026rsquo;s also fast and super easy to use.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a screenshot of someone\u0026rsquo;s game using Dear ImGui.\nCool uh?. It\u0026rsquo;s easy to integrate into your project. The official documentation says integration should take you less than 3 hours. That\u0026rsquo;s a lot of features and awesomeness for such a short amount of time.\nI personally build my projects using unity builds(also called single translation unit compilation). I could not find any guide on how to setup dear imgui for this type of build system.\nSo here\u0026rsquo;s how i did it.\nWhat are unity builds?\rThe standard way of building C/C++ applications is to build each .c/.cpp file separately (each instance is called a translation unit) and link all of them at the linker stage producing the executable.\nUnity build\u0026rsquo;s basic idea is to include every .c/.cpp source file in a single file, and after the preprocessor runs you have just one huge file to compile. Unity builds also have faster compilation time, even while rebuilding the whole project each time. I have seen codebases bigger than 150000 lines compile in a second. really.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 #include \u0026#34;my_other_file.cpp\u0026#34; #include \u0026#34;my_other_file2.cpp\u0026#34; #include \u0026#34;my_other_file3.cpp\u0026#34; int main() { // My program... } 1 jsanchez@scarlet:~$ cl main.cpp If you are not compiling your code like this, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to follow this guide. Head over to the official integration guide.\nCopying files to your project\rStart by downloading Dear ImGui. We are going to select a few source code files from the zip and copy them to our project, feel free to extract it wherever you prefer.\nImGui is meant to be used on many operating systems, alongside many platform libraries and every major rendering api. In order to do its job it needs to read keyboard/mouse/gamepad input, upload textures/buffers to the gpu and render. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of glue code to be done here. Luckily there are many \u0026ldquo;backends\u0026rdquo; ready for you to use.\nIn my case i\u0026rsquo;m using libSDL for my platform code and OpenGL 3.3 as my rendering api. So i need to use the two following backends imgui_impl_sdl and imgui_\rimgui_impl_opengl3. You can find all available backends inside the backends directory.\nNow, create a folder inside your project to hold the Dear ImGui files. Copy the following files from the root directory of the Dear ImGui zip file.\nimconfig.h\rimgui.h\rimgui.cpp\rimgui_draw.cpp\rimgui_demo.cpp\rimgui_internal.h\rimgui_tables.cpp\rimgui_widgets.cpp\rimstb_rectpack.h\rimstb_textedit.h\rimstb_truetype.h Also copy the following files from the backends directory. If you are not using libSDL and OpenGL you will need to replace the following files with whatever files you need.\nimgui_impl_opengl3.cpp\rimgui_impl_opengl3.h\rimgui_impl_opengl3_loader.h\rimgui_impl_sdl.h\rimgui_impl_sdl.cpp Remember to add the new directory holding this files to the project\u0026rsquo;s include path.\nWe are now ready to open our text editor, and because we are using unity builds:\nInstead of doing this.\n1 2 3 #include \u0026#34;imgui.h\u0026#34; #include \u0026#34;imgui_impl_sdl.h\u0026#34; #include \u0026#34;imgui_impl_opengl3.h\u0026#34; We do this!\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 #include \u0026#34;imgui.cpp\u0026#34; #include \u0026#34;imgui_tables.cpp\u0026#34; #include \u0026#34;imgui_widgets.cpp\u0026#34; #include \u0026#34;imgui_draw.cpp\u0026#34; #include \u0026#34;imgui_demo.cpp\u0026#34; // You don\u0026#39;t need this file, i use it as gui reference #include \u0026#34;imgui_impl_opengl3.cpp\u0026#34; #include \u0026#34;imgui_impl_sdl.cpp\u0026#34; We are almost ready to use Dear ImGui. There\u0026rsquo;s just one more problem.\nOpenGL loader clash\rOpenGL is generally implemented in the video driver, and before using it you need to query the driver for function pointers. ImGui has it\u0026rsquo;s own loader but it\u0026rsquo;s not a replacement for a full opengl loader like glad. Since you now have two loaders, your code will not compile because there will be multiple function pointer redefinitions.\nTo solve this #define IMGUI_IMPL_OPENGL_LOADER_CUSTOM before you include your OpenGL loader.\n1 2 #define IMGUI_IMPL_OPENGL_LOADER_CUSTOM #include \u0026#34;glad.c\u0026#34; You are now ready to write some code. You need to write some minimal boilerplate code to get ImGui up and running. I recommend checking the examples directory inside ImGui\u0026rsquo;s zip file and running ImGui\u0026rsquo;s example demo window to get an idea of what can be done. I hope this helps.\nSee you next time!\n","date":"Feb 22","permalink":"https://jsanchez.net/post/integrating_imgui_in_unity_builds/","tags":null,"title":"Integrating Dear ImGui in unity builds"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Let\u0026rsquo;s say you want to allocate a struct that contains a pointer to other data that also needs allocation.

Luckily there\u0026rsquo;s a way to cram all the programmable shader stages in a single file, reducing the number of files at least by half and calm the neat freak inside.\nThese are the two things that make this trick possible.\n#ifdef - glsl\u0026rsquo;s preprocessor directive glShaderSource() The idea is to separate different shader stages inside an #ifdef blocks and setting the corresponding #define directive for the shader stage.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an example of what a shader might look like using this method.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 #ifdef VERTEX_SHADER layout(location = 0) in vec3 Vertices; layout(location = 1) in vec3 Normals; uniform mat4 Model; uniform mat4 View; uniform mat4 Projection; void main() { gl_Position = Projection * View * Model * vec4(Vertices, 1.0); } #endif #ifdef FRAGMENT_SHADER uniform vec3 Color; out vec4 FragColor; void main() { FragColor = vec4(Color, 1.0); } #endif Shader compilation looks something like this:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 char *SourceFile = ReadTextFile(\u0026#34;MyShader.glsl\u0026#34;); // Compile Vertex Shader u32 VertexShaderObject = glCreateShader(GL_VERTEX_SHADER); char *VertexSource[2] = {\u0026#34;#version 330 core\\n#define VERTEX_SHADER\\n\u0026#34;, SourceFile}; glShaderSource(VertexShaderObject, 2, VertexSource, NULL); glCompileShader(VertexShaderObject); // Compile Fragment Shader u32 FragmentShaderObject = glCreateShader(GL_FRAGMENT_SHADER); char *FragmentSource[2] = {\u0026#34;#version 330 core\\n#define FRAGMENT_SHADER\\n\u0026#34;, SourceFile}; glShaderSource(FragmentShaderObject, 2, FragmentSource, NULL); glCompileShader(FragmentShaderObject); // Compile other shader stages // Link program u32 FinalProgram = glCreateProgram(); glAttachShader(FinalProgram, VertexShaderObject); glAttachShader(FinalProgram, FragmentShaderObject); glLinkProgram(Result); Notice that before calling glShaderSource we create an array of two pointers to char, the first one contains glsl\u0026rsquo;s #version preprocessor directive and the token that defines each shader. In the case of the vertex shader the first string looks like this \u0026ldquo;#version 330 core\\n#define VERTEX_SHADER\\n\u0026rdquo;. Sadly the #version directive needs to be the first line in a shader or else compilation fails. Setting the shader version like this is not as pretty or tidy as we may want but it\u0026rsquo;s a tradeoff i\u0026rsquo;m willing to make.

This profile is basically the GPU configuration/settings for an executable. When your software has no application profile, the default graphic card depends on the global GPU settings but it is most likely the integrated gpu. You can manually create an application profile for your executable. The problem is that this profile will need to be manually created for each install. This may be useful if it\u0026rsquo;s a silly program you alone are going to run, but not really an option if you plan to ship software, even if it\u0026rsquo;s to family and friends. Oddly enough you can trick the driver to use an application profile made for other software by simply renaming your executable to something like \u0026ldquo;Doom3.exe\u0026rdquo;. Not really a solution but it\u0026rsquo;s comforting to know simple tricks like these still exist in 2019. Linking your program against nVidia\u0026rsquo;s defined libraries such as \u0026ldquo;nvapi64.dll\u0026rdquo;(The list of libraries is defined in the manual at the bottom of the page). Calling HMODULE Lib = LoadLibraryA(\u0026ldquo;nvapi64.dll\u0026rdquo;) in main function does the trick. This seems to be the old way of doing things, continue reading for a better solution.
