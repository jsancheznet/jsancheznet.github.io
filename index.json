It provides just about every widget you might need, buttons, color pickers, plots and many, many more. It\u0026rsquo;s also fast and super easy to use.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a screenshot of someone\u0026rsquo;s game using Dear ImGui.\nCool uh?. It\u0026rsquo;s easy to integrate into your project. The official documentation says integration should take you less than 3 hours. That\u0026rsquo;s a lot of features and awesomeness for such a short amount of time.\nI personally build my projects using unity builds(also called single translation unit compilation). I could not find any guide on how to setup dear imgui for this type of build system.\nSo here\u0026rsquo;s how i did it.\n\r\r\rWhat are unity builds?\r\rThe standard way of building C/C++ applications is to build each .c/.cpp file separately (each instance is called a translation unit) and link all of them at the linker stage producing the executable.\nUnity build\u0026rsquo;s basic idea is to include every .c/.cpp source file in a single file, and after the preprocessor runs you have just one huge file to compile. Unity builds also have faster compilation time, even while rebuilding the whole project each time. I have seen codebases bigger than 150000 lines compile in a second. really.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  #include \u0026#34;my_other_file.cpp\u0026#34;#include \u0026#34;my_other_file2.cpp\u0026#34;#include \u0026#34;my_other_file3.cpp\u0026#34; int main() { // My program... }   1  jsanchez@scarlet:~$ cl main.cpp   If you are not compiling your code like this, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to follow this guide. Head over to the official integration guide.\n\r\r\rCopying files to your project\r\rStart by downloading Dear ImGui. We are going to select a few source code files from the zip and copy them to our project, feel free to extract it wherever you prefer.\nImGui is meant to be used on many operating systems, alongside many platform libraries and every major rendering api. In order to do its job it needs to read keyboard/mouse/gamepad input, upload textures/buffers to the gpu and render. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of glue code to be done here. Luckily there are many \u0026ldquo;backends\u0026rdquo; ready for you to use.\nIn my case i\u0026rsquo;m using libSDL for my platform code and OpenGL 3.3 as my rendering api. So i need to use the two following backends imgui_impl_sdl and imgui_\rimgui_impl_opengl3. You can find all available backends inside the backends directory.\nNow, create a folder inside your project to hold the Dear ImGui files. Copy the following files from the root directory of the Dear ImGui zip file.\nimconfig.h\rimgui.h\rimgui.cpp\rimgui_draw.cpp\rimgui_demo.cpp\rimgui_internal.h\rimgui_tables.cpp\rimgui_widgets.cpp\rimstb_rectpack.h\rimstb_textedit.h\rimstb_truetype.h\rAlso copy the following files from the backends directory. If you are not using libSDL and OpenGL you will need to replace the following files with whatever files you need.\nimgui_impl_opengl3.cpp\rimgui_impl_opengl3.h\rimgui_impl_opengl3_loader.h\rimgui_impl_sdl.h\rimgui_impl_sdl.cpp\rRemember to add the new directory holding this files to the project\u0026rsquo;s include path.\nWe are now ready to open our text editor, and because we are using unity builds:\nInstead of doing this.\n1 2 3  #include \u0026#34;imgui.h\u0026#34;#include \u0026#34;imgui_impl_sdl.h\u0026#34;#include \u0026#34;imgui_impl_opengl3.h\u0026#34;  We do this!\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7  #include \u0026#34;imgui.cpp\u0026#34;#include \u0026#34;imgui_tables.cpp\u0026#34;#include \u0026#34;imgui_widgets.cpp\u0026#34;#include \u0026#34;imgui_draw.cpp\u0026#34;#include \u0026#34;imgui_demo.cpp\u0026#34; // You don\u0026#39;t need this file, i use it as gui reference#include \u0026#34;imgui_impl_opengl3.cpp\u0026#34;#include \u0026#34;imgui_impl_sdl.cpp\u0026#34;  We are almost ready to use Dear ImGui. There\u0026rsquo;s just one more problem.\n\r\r\rOpenGL loader clash\r\rOpenGL is generally implemented in the video driver, and before using it you need to query the driver for function pointers. ImGui has it\u0026rsquo;s own loader but it\u0026rsquo;s not a replacement for a full opengl loader like glad. Since you now have two loaders, your code will not compile because there will be multiple function pointer redefinitions.\nTo solve this #define IMGUI_IMPL_OPENGL_LOADER_CUSTOM before you include your OpenGL loader.\n1 2  #define IMGUI_IMPL_OPENGL_LOADER_CUSTOM #include \u0026#34;glad.c\u0026#34;  You are now ready to write some code. You need to write some minimal boilerplate code to get ImGui up and running. I recommend checking the examples directory inside ImGui\u0026rsquo;s zip file and running ImGui\u0026rsquo;s example demo window to get an idea of what can be done. I hope this helps.\nSee you next time!\n","date":"Feb 22","permalink":"https://jsanchez.net/post/integrating_imgui_in_unity_builds/","tags":null,"title":"Integrating Dear ImGui in unity builds"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Let\u0026rsquo;s say you want to allocate a struct that contains a pointer to other data that also needs allocation.

In the case of the vertex shader the first string looks like this \u0026ldquo;#version 330 core\\n#define VERTEX_SHADER\\n\u0026rdquo;. Sadly the #version directive needs to be the first line in a shader or else compilation fails. Setting the shader version like this is not as pretty or tidy as we may want but it\u0026rsquo;s a tradeoff i\u0026rsquo;m willing to make.

This profile is basically the GPU configuration/settings for an executable. When your software has no application profile, the default graphic card depends on the global GPU settings but it is most likely the integrated gpu. You can manually create an application profile for your executable. The problem is that this profile will need to be manually created for each install. This may be useful if it\u0026rsquo;s a silly program you alone are going to run, but not really an option if you plan to ship software, even if it\u0026rsquo;s to family and friends. Oddly enough you can trick the driver to use an application profile made for other software by simply renaming your executable to something like \u0026ldquo;Doom3.exe\u0026rdquo;. Not really a solution but it\u0026rsquo;s comforting to know simple tricks like these still exist in 2019. Linking your program against nVidia\u0026rsquo;s defined libraries such as \u0026ldquo;nvapi64.dll\u0026rdquo;(The list of libraries is defined in the manual at the bottom of the page). Calling HMODULE Lib = LoadLibraryA(\u0026ldquo;nvapi64.dll\u0026rdquo;) in main function does the trick. This seems to be the old way of doing things, continue reading for a better solution.
