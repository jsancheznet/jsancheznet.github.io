## [0.5.5] - 16-6-2022

### Changed
- Modified Pathmap class, now it's called MapTile and only has two member variables, x & y, and no functions
- Everytile is no longer stored and linearly searched, we now only store valid map tiles (valid map tiles are less than invalid tiles, so linear search will be faster).
- World::ValidTiles is now a vector instead of a list, faster linear search

### Removed
- Removed all code related to pathfiding, it was too slow, not easy to understand and i'm 99% sure it was not creating optimal paths.
- Ghost now dont call path find.

## [0.5.4] - 14-6-2022

### Changed
- Image files reexported in order to prevent libpng to emit a warning
- Cleaned up Drawer->GetFontResource, it was mostly unused code
- BigDots and SmallDots now reuse the same sprite. Before this change each dot instance loaded its own sprite, the game now loads much faster.
- Avatar no longer stops moving when the next tile would be an invalid tile, ex: pressing up when there's a wall up. It keeps moving.
- Pacman::SetFPS now uses a string instead of stream

### Removed
- Commented/Deprecated Drawer::DrawText Function, it's called nowhere, at least for now.

### Fixed
- Fixed a memory leak caused by not freeing SDL_Texture * these textures where is for rendering Score, Lives, FPS, used to leak one texture per frame
