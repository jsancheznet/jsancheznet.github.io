      <title>Collision Detection: Circle vs Circle</title>

      <description>What is collision detection?&#xD;Wikipedia defines collision detection as &amp;ldquo;the computational problem of detecting the intersection of two or more objects&amp;rdquo;. In real life you cannot go through objects but in a computer simulation objects can overlap and go through each other. In order to resemble reality we need a way to detect when objects are overlapping.&#xA;Imagine two billiard balls, one of them is moving towards the other. In the real world they collide and each ball goes in a different direction.</description>

      <description>Dear Imgui is an awesome C/C++ immediate mode graphical user interface (GUI) made by ocornut. It provides just about every widget you might need, buttons, color pickers, plots and many, many more. It&amp;rsquo;s also fast and super easy to use.&#xA;Here&amp;rsquo;s a screenshot of someone&amp;rsquo;s game using Dear ImGui.&#xA;Cool uh?. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to integrate into your project. The official documentation says integration should take you less than 3 hours. That&amp;rsquo;s a lot of features and awesomeness for such a short amount of time.</description>

      <title>Multiple OpenGL shaders in a single file</title>

      <description>If you have been using OpenGL for a while, you probably have a lot of shader files, maybe one for each programmable stage of the pipeline. At some point during development the directory that contains the shaders becomes a mess, managing and opening shader files in your editor becomes tedious. Luckily there&amp;rsquo;s a way to cram all the programmable shader stages in a single file, reducing the number of files at least by half and calm the neat freak inside.</description>

      <title>Handling Hybrid GPU&#39;s in Windows</title>

      <description>Hybrid GPU&amp;rsquo;s are everywhere these days and yet it is not obvious how to run your program using the discrete GPU.&#xA;I can think of 5 ways on how to get this done:&#xA;Your software is popular enough that the GPU manufacturer includes an &amp;ldquo;application profile&amp;rdquo; for your software in their driver. This profile is basically the GPU configuration/settings for an executable. When your software has no application profile, the default graphic card depends on the global GPU settings but it is most likely the integrated gpu.</description>

      <title>Making multi-line macros behave as a functions</title>
      <link>https://jsanchez.net/post/multi-line-function-macro/</link>

      <description>When you need a muli-line macro to have its own scope and behave as a regular function would, the naive way is to simply wrap the macro statements inside curly brackets. Now, time has passed and suddenly program compilation is failing, and as usual the compiler output is not helping. The naive macro implementation has come back to bite you.&#xA;Here&amp;rsquo;s the naive implementation, let&amp;rsquo;s see how to fix it.</description>
